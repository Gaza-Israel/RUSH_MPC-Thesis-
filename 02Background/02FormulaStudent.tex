\section{Formula Student}

In a formula student competition, two types of evaluation exist, the first category is comprised of static events where the design, cost, and business model of the prototype are analyzed. In the dynamic category, each prototype is evaluated through 5 different events: Skidpad, Acceleration, AutoX, Endurance, and Efficiency (evaluated in the Endurance track), as shown in figure \Cref{fig:fs_tracks}. To be able to compete in dynamic events each prototype needs to pass a series of safety and rule compliance inspections, a process which starts even before de competition with the documentation analysis and finishes with on-site scrutineering.

The Skidpad event is the least relevant for this study as it is designed to test the cornering ability of the vehicle. It is comprised of two circles of radius $9.125m$, where the vehicle performs an adaptation first lap and then the lap time is measured on the second lap, when the car is at steady state cornering. As it is a tight and steady course, the power consumption is low not reaching the regulations limit of $80kW$, thus the dynamic response and efficiency of the motors have almost no relevance to the performance. 

The acceleration event consists of a standing start $75m$ straight acceleration, with the maximum battery power limited to $80kw$, as it is for all Formula Student events. For this event, the key factors from a powertrain point of view are the torque dynamic response, and how efficiently the powertrain system can deliver power to the ground.

The AutoX is a $1km$ track with several corners and straights mixed. In this test, an increased dynamic response can delay the braking zone, and the efficiency allows it to reach higher velocities using the same amount of power. Lastly, the endurance event is similar to the AutoX, with enough laps to complete $22km$. In this event, although improved dynamics can be beneficial, efficiency is the key factor as it results in more available energy to complete the $22km$ track while also scoring points in the Efficiency category. 

For the autonomous part of the competition, there are very similar events, with the Skidpad and Acceleration being the same as in the manual mode. The driverless AutoX needs to be a little different, with a smaller distance for the \gls{asr} to be able to see the car throughout the entire track and press the emergency button if necessary. The Endurance event driverless analogous is the TrackDrive event, usually being on the same track as the AutoX, but with fixed 10 laps. Currently, the points performance in the driverless events is mostly dictated by how good the autonomous software is, but as the teams evolve, the cars will play a major role in the results, the same way as it is in the manual category.


Since the FST07, \gls{fst} has used AMK motors and inverters~\cite{amk:DD5-14-10-POW,amk:KW26-S5-FSE-4Q} (datasheets shown in \Cref{chapter:appendixDatasheets}), this set is a good solution for teams switching to a four-motor setup as it is already paired and has good documentation. However, as the team evolves, it is natural to look for improvements, and the AMK inverters were deemed one of the prototypes' current bottlenecks. The use of \gls{igbt} as the switching component, means that this inverter is capped in its switching frequency, using only 8kHz. This low switching frequency reduces powertrain efficiency and increases the set's weight. Another drawback of this solution is the control method as it uses a simple \gls{foc}, thus having a low dynamic response and further reducing efficiency by not using \gls{mtpa} strategies.
A brief outline of the current specification of \gls{fst}'s prototype is shown in \Cref{table:fst13_specs}.
