This work presents the development of a control strategy for the motors of the Formula Student Team of Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The control strategy was developed with the main goal of improving the dynamic response of the motor torque and the system efficiency. The motor was experimentally characterized and a simulation environment was created to test different control strategies. The explicit \gls{mpc} was selected as the most suitable strategy due to its fast response and low current ripple. A novel horizon extention technique was proposed to reduce model mismatch, which gave the name of the controller: \acrfull{rush}. The control strategy was implemented in an \gls{fpga} and a test bench setup was developed. The experimental results showed a close match with the simulation results, validating the torque estimation, the current measurements, and the control strategy. The system efficiency was improved due to the reduction in current \gls{thd} and the torque response was improved by orders of magnitude compared to the current solution.
