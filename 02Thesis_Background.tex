\chapter{Theoretical Background and PMSM Model}
\label{chapter:background}%chktex 24

\minitoc% Creating a minitoc

This chapter covers some fundamentals used to develop this work. It starts with a brief overview of Formula Student competitions and the current powertrain system used by \gls{fst}. After this, it presents the basics on \gls{vsi} and modulation techniques before developing a mathematical model for the used motors and later converting it to discrete time. Lastly, a quick overview of the literature control methods is done before introducing the proposed strategy.
