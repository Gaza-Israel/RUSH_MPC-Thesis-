The theory of FW is described by taking into account different control schemes. The advantages and drawbacks of each one are discussed, as well. Moreover, some motor design considerations for achieving an effective FW operation are illustrated for permanent magnet (PM), wound rotor (WR) and reluctance (REL) synchronous machines, using the per unit approach. The distinguishing characteristic of this review provides two-fold attention on both machine design and control strategies obtained by several collaborations with industrial and commercial companies.},

  abstract = {In this paper, benchmark of Si IGBT, SiC MOSFET, and Gallium nitride (GaN) HEMT power switches at 600-V class is conducted in single-phase T-type inverter. Gate driver requirements, switching performance, inverter efficiency performance, heat sink volume, output filter volume, and dead-time effect for each technology is evaluated. Gate driver study shows that GaN has the lowest gate driver losses above 100 kHz and below 100 kHz, SiC has lowest gate losses. GaN has the best switching performance among three technologies that allows high efficiency at high-frequency applications. GaN-based inverter operated at 160-kHz switching frequency with 97.3% efficiency at 2.5-kW output power. Performance of three device technologies at different temperature, switching frequency, and load conditions shows that heat sink volume of the converter can be reduced by 2.5 times by switching from Si to GaN solution at 60 °C case temperature, and for SiC and GaN, heat sink volume can be reduced by 2.36 and 4.92 times, respectively, by increasing heat sink temperature to 100 °C. Output filter volume can be reduced by 43% with 24, 26, and 61 W increase in device power loss for GaN-, SiC-, and Si-based converters, respectively. WBG devices allow reduction of harmonic distortion at output current from 3.5% to 1.5% at 100 kHz.},

This survey paper highlights the most relevant MPC techniques for power electronic systems.

Design choices, and parameters that affect the system performance, closed-loop stability, and controller robustness are discussed. Moreover, solvers, and control platforms that can be employed for the real-time implementation of MPC algorithms are presented. Finally, the MPC schemes in question are assessed, among others, in terms of design, and computational complexity, along with their performance, and applicability depending on the power electronic system at hand.},

  abstract  = {Vector controlled drives that known as Field Oriented Control (FOC) and Direct Torque Control (DTC), were initially proposed for induction motor drives but recently they have also been investigated in other motor types. This paper presents detailed comparisons between the FOC and the DTC control schemes for Permanent Magnet Sycnhronous Motors (PMSMs). The advantages and disadvantages of the two control schemes are evaluated in terms of torque and speed behaviors and the analysis has been carried out to illustrate the features of both methods by different load simulation tests. In addition, inverter switching frequencies have been measured and compared to give a new comparison criteria to users. The numerical simulations have showed that the FOC controlled scheme has faster speed dynamic response and it has less torque ripples. When inverter switching frequencies have compared, it must be pointed out that switching freqency of the DTC scheme is about %80 lesser than the FOC scheme.},

In broadband WiMax applications, GaN HEMTs offer very wide bandwidths while meeting the IEEE 802.16e standard with >25% drain efficiency. SiC Schottky diodes are allowing up to a 25% reduction in losses in power supplies for computers and servers when used in the power factor correction circuit. Even higher efficiencies can be obtained when the SiC Schottkys are combined with a SiC MOSFET as the switch, resulting in yet another 22% reduction in losses. For motor control, SiC Schottkys allow a >35% reduction in losses, as demonstrated for a 3 HP motor drive},

The main characteristics of vector control and direct torque control are studied by simulation emphasizing their advantages and disadvantages. The performances of the two control techniques are evaluated in terms of torque and current ripples, and transient responses to load toque variation. The simulation results show that the two control schemes provide in their basic configuration, comparable performances regarding the torque control, however the choice for the DTC appears advantageous in many respects, and presents a low cost solution for applications where low torque ripple is not a major issue.},

The two-axis machine model parameters are evaluated by experiments performed on an IPMSM using a controlled voltage-source inverter and are compared with parameter values evaluated by the finite-element method. The evaluation of two-axis machine model parameters reveals significant saturation and cross-magnetization effects in both axes, especially in the flux-weakening regime.},

To show the diversity and simple realization with various control performances of the strategy, in this paper, several different FCS-MPCs with their working mechanisms are introduced. Comparison of FCS-MPC with conventional control strategies for electric drives is presented. Furthermore, extensive control issues, e.g. encoderless control and disturbance observation are also included in this work. Finally, the trend of research hot topics on MPC is discussed.},
